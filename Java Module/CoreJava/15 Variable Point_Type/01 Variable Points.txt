Need of this chapter:
___________________________
In this chapter we will learn creating primitive and referenced variables 
for storing values and objects temporarily during program execution.

In this chapter we will learn :
        > storing values of an object and
        → storing values of an operation

We will also learn storing common values and individual values by
        >allocating memory common to all objects and
        >allocating memory individual to each object separatly

Also we will learn
        > Receving and Storing input values for a method and
        → Storing output values of a method

What is a variable and what is the use of variable?
======================================================================
A variable is a named memory location.
It is used for storing a value (or) object reference temporarily during program execution.

How can create a variable?
=================================
A variable is created by using data type either by using PDT (or) by using RDT

-> For storing mathematical value
    we will create variable by using PDTs
            byte/short/int/long/float/double/char/boolean

-> For storing object
    we will create variable by using RDTs
            array/class/interface/enum/annotation

Basic Syntax to create variable:
```````DT varName = value;
 PDT    [single mathematical value]
 RDT    [Object reference]

 NOTE : * Object is created using 'new' keyword

Test01.java
/////////////////
    class Example {

        int x = 10;
        int y = 20;
    }

    class Test01{

    public static void main(String[] args) {

            int p = 50;
            int q = m1();

            String s1 = "Hari";
            String s2 = new String("Hari");

        Example e1 = new Example();
        }

        static int m1(){
            return 60;
    }}

What are the diff operations we can perform on a variable?
=============================================================================
On a variable basically we will perform 2 operations

    1) creating variable memory         int x;   //x[10]
    2) accessing variable               x=10:    //Sopin(x);     //O/P 10

variable
> creation    DT vn;
> accesssing    vn

Creation :
    without initial value   - dec
    with initial value  - def

Accessing :
    storing value first time    - initializations
    modifying value             - assign
    taking existing value       - reading

Variable Terminology                    Sample code :
======================
                                        
1. variable declaration             -   int x;
2. variable definition              -   int y = 20
3. variable initialization          -   x = 40
4. variable assignment              -   x = 50
5. variable reading                 -   int z = x
                                        Sopln(x);
6. int z = x+y;
7. p =x+y+z

Summary:
========
Basically we will do two things on a variable

1. Variable declaration     ->  new memory is created

2. Varaible accessing :
                        → initializing           |
                        → assigning/modifying    |  existing memory will be used
                        → reading                |

Rule: in accessing variable, that variable should be declared in previous lines
Rule: in reading variable it should have value.

Identify what is the output from below program?
-----------------------------------------------
    Sopln(a);

    int a = 10 ;
    Sopin (a);

    int b;
    Sopln(b);

    b = 20;
    Sopln(b);

    c = 30;
    Sopln(c);

    a = c ;
    Sopln(a);

    class Test{
        psvm ( S [] a){
            int x;
            //sop(x);

            x = 10;
            sop(x);

            x = 20;
            sop(x);
        }
    }

Limitations on variables
================================
1.for a variable new memory is allocated only if it has data type before its name.

2. when we store/assign value to a variable new memory is not created, 
    existing memory is accessing, in that memory this value is stored

3. when we read variable value, it must have value, else we will get CE.
    The value is read from its memory not from previous line

4. when we assign new value, old value is replaced with new value

5. When we read a variable value, always we get the latest modified value

    class Test02 {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

            int p;
            Example e;

            p = 50;
            e = new Example();

            p = 70;
            e = new Example();
        }
    }


    class Test03 {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

            int a = 50;
            System.out.println("a: "+a);

            a = 70;
            System.out.println("a: "+a);

            Example e1 = new Example();
            System.out.println("el: "+e1);

            e1 = new Example();
            System.out.println("el: "+e1);
    }}

Primitive variable
=============================== Vs
    1) A variable that is created by using primitive data type is 
        called primitive variable.
                Ex: int a = 10

    2) A primitive variable allows us to store only mathematical value

    3) we can use primitive variables in calculations, because the generated result is meaningful
            For example:
                    int a = 10
                    int b = 20
                    int c = a + b
    4) If we print primitive variable, directly the value available in primitive variable is displayed.
        Ex: System.out.println(a); //10

Referenced variable
=========================================
    1) A variable that is created by using referenced data type is called referenced variable
            Ex: Example e1 = new Example();

    2) A referenced variable allows us to store only reference of the object but not mathematical value.

    3) we can not use referenced variable calculations, compiler will throw error, 
        because the newly generated reference does not point to any object
        For example:
            Example e1 = new Example();
            Example e2 = new Example();
            Example e3 = e1 + e2:

    4) If we print referenced variable, values of the object is not display 
        rather object's classname@hashcode in hexa string format is displayed.

        For example:
                    System.out.println(e1);
                    //Example@28a418fc

    Example e1 = new Example();
    Sopln(e1.x);
    Sopln(e1.y);

    Sopln(new Example().x);
    Sopln(new Example(),y);
