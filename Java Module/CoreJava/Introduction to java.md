# Java Interview Q&A Flashcards

## 1. What is Java?
ðŸ‘‰ Java is a **high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent language** developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995.

---

## 2. What are the main features of Java?
ðŸ‘‰ Simple, Object-Oriented, Platform-Independent, Robust, Secure, Multithreaded, Distributed.

---

## 3. Difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
- **JVM**: Executes bytecode.  
- **JRE**: JVM + libraries to run Java programs.  
- **JDK**: JRE + development tools (compiler, debugger).

---

## 4. What makes Java platform-independent?
ðŸ‘‰ Java code is compiled into **bytecode**, which runs on the **JVM** across different platforms.

---

## 5. Difference between Java and C++?
ðŸ‘‰ Java is platform-independent, has garbage collection, does not support multiple inheritance directly, and is purely object-oriented (except primitives).

---

## 6. Explain OOP concepts in Java.
- **Encapsulation** â†’ Binding data & methods in a class.  
- **Inheritance** â†’ Reuse of parent class properties.  
- **Polymorphism** â†’ One task in multiple forms (overloading/overriding).  
- **Abstraction** â†’ Hiding implementation details.

---

## 7. What is Garbage Collection in Java?
ðŸ‘‰ Automatic memory management that clears unused objects from **heap memory**.

---

## 8. Difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions?
- **Checked**: Checked at compile time (IOException).  
- **Unchecked**: Occur at runtime (NullPointerException).

---

## 9. What are `final`, `static`, `this`, and `super` used for?
- **final** â†’ Constants, prevent inheritance/overriding.  
- **static** â†’ Belongs to class, not object.  
- **this** â†’ Refers to current object.  
- **super** â†’ Refers to parent class.

---

## 10. Why is Java popular?
ðŸ‘‰ Because of **WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere)**, security, strong memory management, community support, and wide usage in **Web, Mobile, Enterprise, Cloud** applications.

## 11.Why java invented ?
 - The java was invented for achieving platform independency.  For develope both 
         - I. Stand alone 
         - II. Internet applications

         Note: Using java language we can develope Both.

## 12. Types Of applications ?
- All available softwares of project on applications are broadly divided into 2 types.
                 - I. Stand alone  - Single comp. and single user app
                 - II. Internet applications - Multi comp. and multi user app 

       **Stand alone app** : An app that is install in one computer and it is accesible within the same computer  and if it is not accesible from other computer via internet is called stand alone app.

       - **Example** - Calculator, Notepade, MS- Office , Antivirus, OS, VLC player etc.           

       **Internet applications** : An app that is install in one computer and if it can be accesible from other computers via internet is called internet application.

       - **Example** - tcs.com, shaddi.com, bookmytrip.com etc....
