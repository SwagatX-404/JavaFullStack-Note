# Java Interview Q&A Flashcards

## 1. What is Java?
ðŸ‘‰ Java is a **high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent language** developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995.

---

## 2. What are the main features of Java?
ðŸ‘‰ Simple, Object-Oriented, Platform-Independent, Robust, Secure, Multithreaded, Distributed.

---

## 3. Difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
- **JVM**: Executes bytecode.  
- **JRE**: JVM + libraries to run Java programs.  
- **JDK**: JRE + development tools (compiler, debugger).

---

## 4. What makes Java platform-independent?
ðŸ‘‰ Java code is compiled into **bytecode**, which runs on the **JVM** across different platforms.

---

## 5. Difference between Java and C++?
ðŸ‘‰ Java is platform-independent, has garbage collection, does not support multiple inheritance directly, and is purely object-oriented (except primitives).

---

## 6. Explain OOP concepts in Java.
- **Encapsulation** â†’ Binding data & methods in a class.  
- **Inheritance** â†’ Reuse of parent class properties.  
- **Polymorphism** â†’ One task in multiple forms (overloading/overriding).  
- **Abstraction** â†’ Hiding implementation details.

---

## 7. What is Garbage Collection in Java?
ðŸ‘‰ Automatic memory management that clears unused objects from **heap memory**.

---

## 8. Difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions?
- **Checked**: Checked at compile time (IOException).  
- **Unchecked**: Occur at runtime (NullPointerException).

---

## 9. What are `final`, `static`, `this`, and `super` used for?
- **final** â†’ Constants, prevent inheritance/overriding.  
- **static** â†’ Belongs to class, not object.  
- **this** â†’ Refers to current object.  
- **super** â†’ Refers to parent class.

---

## 10. Why is Java popular?
ðŸ‘‰ Because of **WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere)**, security, strong memory management, community support, and wide usage in **Web, Mobile, Enterprise, Cloud** applications.

## 11.Why java invented ?
 - The java was invented for achieving platform independency.  For develope both 
         - I. Stand alone 
         - II. Internet applications

         Note: Using java language we can develope Both.

## 12. Types Of applications ?
- All available softwares of project on applications are broadly divided into 2 types.
                 - I. Stand alone 
                 - II. Internet applications
