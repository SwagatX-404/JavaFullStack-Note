this keyword points
================================================================================

1) What is this keyword and what is the use of this keyword?
2) What is current object, how can we access current object members inside a non-static method or constructor or NSB?
3) What are the compiler & JVM activities with respect to this keyword?
4) If we modify CO values by using this kw, are those modifications effected to calling method?
5) Prove that :
        1) this is a referenced type parameter variable of cons and NSM?
        2) this is a final variable?
        3) this variable type is current class type?
        4) this variable contains current object reference?
6) What are the rules on this keyword?
        1) can we access it in static members?
        2) can we access it in non-static members?
        3) can we access it at class level in invoking var or method?
        4) can we print this keyword?
        5) can we pass it as arg and can we return it from method?
7) When "this" is a paramter name, why is it created as keyword?

What is a this and what is the use of this?
===============================================================================
        class Example {

            int x = 10;

            void m1(){
            Sopin(x);
            }

            ps v main(String[] args){

            Example e1 = new Example();
            e1.m1();
            }
        }

this keyword points
================================================================================

1) The keyword this is a parameter final referenced variable of current class type. 
    It is used for receiving and storing current object reference in a constructor
    or in a non-static method for accessing NSV from current object either 
    for reading or modifying its value.

2) When we create a constructor or a non-static method, compiler will automatically
    will add this keyword as first prameter with the current class as its type
    as shown below
    
    DWC:
==============
    class Example {
    Example(){ }
    void m1(){ }
    }

CGC:
==============
    class Example {
    Example(final Example this){ }
    void m1(final Example this){ }
    }

3) When we access a NSV or a NSM in a NSB/constructor/non-static method, 
   compiler will automatically adds this. as reference to NSV and NSM accessing statements

DWC:
====
    class Example{
        int x = 10;

        void m1(){
            Sopln(x);
        }
    }

CGC:
=====
    class Example{
         int x = 10;

         void m1(Example this){
            Sopln(this.x);
         }
    }

4) When we call a consturctor or a non-static method, as a fist step JVM will 
    create this keyword memory, stores current object's reference, 
    pointing to this object Then further executes method logic.

Inside method logic JVM will read and modify NSV value in this variable 
pointing object as shown below

        class Example {
            int x = 10;
            void m1(){
            Sopin(x);
            x = 20;
        }

        ps v main(S[] args){
            Ex e1 = new Ex();
            e1.x = 15;
            e1.m1();
            Sopln(e1.x);
            }
        }

5) In projects, we must develop constructor and NSM logic common to all objects 
    and further we must execute this logic specific to one object.

For this purpose inside constructor and NSM logic we must access NSV and NSM directly 
by their name or by using this kw.

Then further we must invoke constructor and NSM by using the object for which 
we want to execute this logic.

For example:
            e1.m1();
            e2.m1();
