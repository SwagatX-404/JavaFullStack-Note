ðŸ“˜ Variables in Java
=====================
Variables are used to store data values in a program.
In Java, variables are mainly divided into 2 types:

           1) Primitive Variables (PVs)
           2) Reference Variables (RVs)

Based on Place we declare, Both PVs and RVs are divided in 2 types
          
           I) Class Level Variables
           II) Methode Level Variables

I) Class Level Variables 
===========================
    -> A PVs or a RVs declared inside class out side of all methode is called "Class Level Variable"
    -> Can be used by all methods.
    -> LifeSpan - As long as the object exists

II) Methode Level Variables
===========================
    -> A PVs or a RVs declared inside methode is called "Methode Level Variable"
    -> Accessible only within that method.
    -> LifeSpan - Exists only during method execution.
