===================================================================================
1. What is an inheritance?
	- Inheritnace is a one of the OOP principles	

	- It is a Parent-Child relation

	- The process of creating a new class/object 
	  deriving from an existing class/object 
	  is called inheritance.
	
	- For example:  
	  class A { }
	  class B extends A{ } //here we are deriving 
	                       //class B from class A

	- class A is called Super class or Parent class Or Base class
	- class B is called Sub class or Child class or Derived class

2. Why Inheritance?
	- We will develop inheritance for obtaining 
	  'type, properties and behaviors' of 
	  an existing class/object to new class/object
	  for treating this new class/object as sub type of 
	  an existing class/object 
	  
	- For example  
		- for creating Student as Person type
		- for creating Lion    as Animal type
		- for creating Bus     as Vehicle type
	   we must develop inheritance
	   
	- As part of inherintace we will develop
	  a new class as child classes or sub type classes 
	  of an existing class or object.

3. When must we develop inheritance?
   we must develop inheritance in the below two situations
	1. for extending or implementing existing class functionality 
	   by adding new properties and new behviours in this 
	   new class as sub type
	   
	   - For example:
		class Person { String name;}
		class Student extends Person{ String course;}
		
	   - for adding more properties and behaviors to Person 
	     we will extend Person class by creating new class
	  
	2. for creating multiple new objects of same type as one group 
	   for achieving 'code reusability and loose coupling' 
	   between user object and sub type objects 
	   we will develop inheritance.
	   
	     - For example: without inheritance
		class Person { }	here all these 4 objects	
		class Student { }	are individual objects	
		class Faculty { }	not same type of objects
		class Admin { }
	   
	     - with inheritance we can create Student, Faculty and Admin
	       objects as same type of objects Person
	     
		class Person { }	
		class Student extends Person{ }	
		class Faculty extends Person{ }		
		class Admin   extends Person{ }	

4. Definitaion of inheritance as per interview?
	- The inheritance is one of the OOP principles
	- It is a Parent-Child relation
	
	- The process of creating new class deriving from an existing class
	  for obtaining exiting object properties and behaviours to the new object
	  for extending or implementing existing object functionality is called
	  inheritnace.
	  
	- As part of inheritance we will create sub types of an existing object

	- The advantanges of inheritance are
		1. Obtaining type
		2. Code resuability
		3. Overring the functionality
		4. Extending the functionality 
		5. Implement the functionality
		6. Loose coupling
		7. Runtime Polymorphsim
		

5. How can we develop inheritance?
	- by using the keywords
		1. extends 
		2. implements

	- For deriving a class from an interface 
	  we must use implements keyword
	   for example:
	   	interface Example { }
		class Sample implements Example{ }

	- For deriving a class from a class or 
	  for deriving an interface from an interface
	  we must use extends keyword
	   for example:
		class A { }
		class B extends A { }

		interface I1 { }
		interface I2 extends I1 { }
		class C implements I2 { }

 6. Sample program and execution flow
	//Example.java 
	class Example {
	   static int a = 10;
	   int x = 20;
	}

     //====================================================
	//Sample.java
	class Sample extends Example {	//IS-A relation(Inheritance)
                                  
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Sample s1 = new Sample(); //accessing with IS-A relation
			System.out.println(s1.a);
			System.out.println(s1.x);
		}
	    
	}

7) Identify are below objects' classes created correctly or wrongly?
	class Student {}	wrong design

	class Lion {}		wrong design

	class HDFCBank {}	wrong design

	class Rectangle {}	wrong design

	class Airtel {}		wrong design

   becuase all above objects are not main or individual objects
   the above all objects are sub types of other main or individual objects
   so we must create above classes as sub type but not as individual objects 

   below code shows creating above objects as sub types 
   by developing inheritance by using 'extends and implement' keywords
	class Person { }
	class Student extends Person{ }		//correct desing

	interface Animal { }
	class Lion implements Animal { }	//correct desing

	class Bank { }
	class HDFCBank extends Bank { }		//correct desing

	interface Shape { }
	class Rectangle implements Shape { }	//correct desing

	interface Sim { }
	class Airtel implements Sim { }		//correct desing

8) How many ways we can reuse existing class members in new class?
   In 2 ways	
	1. by using HAS-A relation (Association)
	2. by using IS-A relation (Inheritance)

	- HAS-A relation means 
		creating existing class object in new class
		and accessing members by using the existing class object
	
	- IS-A relation	means
		creating new class deriving from an existing class
		and accessing existing class members by using this new class object

 - Below code explains access Person class members in Student class for Person object
   with HAS-A relation( Person class members are not executing for Student object)

	class Person {
		Sting name;

		void eat() {
			System.out.println(name + " is eating");
		}
	}

	class Student {  
		public static void main(String[] args) {
		  //=== HAS-A === realation wise reusing
			Person p1 = new Person();//Student class is reusing
			p1.name = "Hari";	//Person class and its memebers
			p1.eat();		//for perform operation for Person
		}
	}
	with HAS-A relation we are reusing 
	Person and its members for Person but not for student

	for using Person members for Student, 
	we must develop IS-A realtion(Inheritance)

	By developing inheritance we are 
	'extending and reusing' existing class members
	for new class object as if those existing members are
	available in this new class

	class Student extends Person { //extending Person to use as Student

		public static void main(String[] args) {
		  //reusing with IS-A relation	
			Student s1 = new Student();	
			s1.name = "hari";	//we are accessing and reusing
			s1.eat();		//existing class Person members
						//as if those were own members of 
		}				//Student object 
	}

  //=====================================================================
	Inheritance is meant for 'extending + reusing'
  //=====================================================================

9) Can we store one class object in another class type referenced variable?
   If object's class is SUB CLASS of referenced variable class, 
   we can store.

  Identify CE in the below program?

	class Animal { }
	class Lion { }

	class Test {
	   public static void main(String[] args) {

		Animal a1 = new Animal();	//allowed, same type
		Lion   l1 = new Lion();		//allowed, same type

		//Animal a2 = new Lion();	//not allowed, not IS-A relation
		Person p1 = new Student();	//allowd, Student IS-A Person type

	   }
	}

  when we develop inheritance, 
	the new type object/class obtains the existing object/class 
	  'type, properites and behaviors' and 
	this new object is considered as
	existing class object type.

  hence we can stored the sub type object
	//1. either in its own type referenced variable
	//2. or     in its super type referenced variable

	Student s1 = new Student(); //same type referenced variable, allowed
	Person  p1 = new Student(); //super type referenced variable, allowed

  but we can not store Super class object in sub class type variable	
	Student s2 = new Person(); //not allowed, 
			//sub type refernced variable with super type object

//concusion: 
 - The object type class(RIGHT side class) 
    must be same or sub type class of variable type class(LEFT side)

	A a1  = new B();

	class B must be sub class of class A
	else we will get CE: incompatible types

//Creating Person as super class common to all sub classes Student, 
//Faculty and Admin with common properties and behaviors of all sub types
//persopn.java
class Person {
	
	static int eyes;
	static int ears;
	
	String name;
	double height;
	double weight;
	
	void eat() 	{ System.out.println(name + " is eating Veg"); }
	void sleep(){ System.out.println(name + " is Deep Sleeping");}
	void walk() { System.out.println(name + " is walking from Ameerpet to Hostel");}
	
}
//new type of object extending the existing object Person
//and having specific properties and behaviors of this sub type object
class Student extends Person { //1. inheritance [for obtaining t,p,b]
	
		//+
	
//2. extending functionality [adding more properties and behaviors ]	
	int sno;				  //[as per this new object JOB/functionality]
	String course;
	double fee;
						//3. reusing super class property in sub class 
						//directly by its name as if it is 
						//declared in sub class
	void listen() { System.out.println(name + " is listening " + course); }
	void reply() { System.out.println(name + " is replying " + course + " questions");}
	void write() { System.out.println(name + " is writing " + course + " notes");}
	void read() { System.out.println(name + " is reading " + course + " notes");}
}

//another sub type Employee
class Employee extends Person {
	double sal;  //common properties of all employees
	double exp;
}

class Faculty extends Employee {
	
	int fno;				//specific properties of Faculty
	String dept;
	
	void teach() { }
	void conductExam() { }
	
}

class Admin extends Employee {
	int ano;				//specific properties of Admin
	String block;
	
	void checkIDCard() { }
}

public class Institute { //user class for accessing object [super and sub type]
						//functionality
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Person p;
		
		//Obtaining type [storing sub class object in super class variable]
		p = new Student();
		p = new Faculty();
		p = new Admin();
		
		//reusing both sub class and super class members 
		//by using sub type
		Student s1 = new Student();
		s1.name = "HK";
		s1.course = "FSD";

		s1.eat();
		s1.listen();
		s1.read();
		s1.sleep();
	

	}
}

Problem in the above code is it is weak encapsulated class
because we have provided direct access to fields of sub class and super
it is a wrong design code

Sample project on OOP Basics, Encapsulation and Inheritance

	  extending and reusing exising class/object 
	  functionality as sub type

 * What is an inheritance and why inheritance?
 *  - It is a one of the OOP principles
 * 
 *  - It is a parent-child relation
 *  	- Here parent means the existing class
 *  	- Child means the new class deriving from this existing class
 *  
 *  - The process of creating a new class deriving from an existing class
 *    for obtaining type, properties and behaviors of an existing object to 
 *    this new object for "extending or implementing" that existing object 
 *    functionality by adding new properties and behavior implementation
 *    is called inheritance
 *   
 * When must we develop inheritance?
 *  - for creating a sub type object 
 *    for extending or implementing functionality 
 *    of an existing object by adding new properties and 
 *    behaviors as per this new object job/functionality 
 *  
 *  - and also inheritance is used for   
 *    creating multiple objects of same type as
 *    one type for achieving code reusability, 
 *     Loose coupling and runtime polymorphism
 *    between user object and sub type objects
 *
 * How can we develop inheritance?
 * 	by using two keywords
 * 		1. extends
 * 		2. implements
 *      
 *     - we must use extends keyword
 *         	for deriving a new class from an existing class or 
 *         	for deriving a new interface from an existing interface
 *         
 *     - we must use implements keyword
 *     		for deriving a new class from an existing interface
 *     
 * For what purpose we must develop inheritance?
 * 	1. Is it for reusing?    No
 * 	2. Is it for extending?  Yes
 * 
 *      Inheritance is meant for 'extending and then reusing'
 *      
 *      For just reusing do not develop inheritance
 *      develop HAS-A relation, means create object of that class
 *      and access its members
 *      
 *      Inheritance is meant for 
 *      	[extending + reusing]
 *
 * Why must we develop inheritance, means why must we develop
 * separate sub class, why can not we develop all properties and 
 * behaviors of different sub type objects in single class?           
 * 
 * - If we place all different sub type objects properties and
 * 	behaviors in a single class we can not separate and reuse
 *  each sub type properties and behaviors as specific type of object
 *  
 * - We must place common properties and behaviors 
 *   of all sub types in one class that is super class
 *   and we must place a sub type individual properties and
 *   behaviors in a separate class as sub class extending from
 *   this super class  
 * 
 * - By creating as separate class we are separating properties and 
 *   behaviors of one sub type from other sub types, so that we 
 *   use this object as a special operations object.
 *   
 * - By extending from super class, this new class/object
 *   is treated as the super class object type, then 
 *   where ever the super type object is allowed to there 
 *   this new sub type object is also allowed to store, pass and return 
 *   
 * - for example if we do not create Student as sub class of 
 *   class Person, then Student is not look as Person
