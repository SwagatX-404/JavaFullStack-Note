→When we develop inheritance, what will subclass get?
========================================================================
    1) type
    2) properties
    3) behaviours of super class

What is the meaning of obtaining super cls type to subcls?
========================================================================
    sub class will be treated as of super class type, then 
    where ever super class type variable exist, to there 
    we can pass and store sub class object reference as below

            class Person{}
            class Student extends Person{}

            Student s1 = new Student();
            Person p1 = new Student(); ✓

            void m1(Person p){
            }

            m1(new Person());
            m1(new Student());

Summary:
=======
    We must follow the rule for storing one class object 
    in another class type variable, those both class must have
    inheritance relation.

The object type class must be sub class of variable type class

Example:
    class Animal{}
    class Tiger{}

    Animal a = new Tiger();   //CE:Tiger is not created as sub class of Animal

========================================================================
    What is the meaning of sub class obtain properties and behaivours of super class?

    What is the menaing of super class members are inherited to sub class?

    Does mean, are all members of super class copy and pasted in sub class.class file?

| The meaning of super class members are inherited to sub class (or)
  the meaning of sub class obtain super class properties and behaviours is:

Sub class will get permission to access super class properties and behaviours
        1) either directly by their name in sub class
        2) or by using sub class name
        3) or by using sub class object ref
as if they were defined in the sub class.


            class A{

                static int a = 10;
                int x = 20;

            static void m1(){
             Sopln("m1");
            }

            void m2(){
             Sopln("m2");
            }
            }
    super class
    ===========
    type
    properties
    behaviours
    ===========
    sub class

            class B extends A {

            ps v main(String[] args){
            Sopln(a);
            m1();

            Sopln(X);  //CE
            m2();   //CE
            }}

Is it possible to access all members of super class in sub class?
========================================================================
No, only visible members are accessible

What are the members visible to subclass?
========================================================================

    1. only protected and public membes are always visible to same package or 
            another package subclasses
    2. default members are visible to only same package subclasses
    3. private members are not visible to either same/different pacakge sub classes

We can not access private members of super class in subclass, compiler will throw error.

        pkg p1
        class B extends class A
            private p
                    q
            protected r
            public   s

        pkg p2
        class B


Is it possible to access all members of super class from sub class? 
No, only visible members are allowed
========================================================================
package p2;

    class B extends A {
         only protected and public memers are visible to here
       }
    default is visible only within the same pack
