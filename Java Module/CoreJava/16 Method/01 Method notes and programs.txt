    class BankAccount{
        String bname;
        String brname;
        String ifsc;
        long accnum;
        String acchname;
        double balance;
    }

    class Bank{
        psvm (s[] args){
            BankAccount acc = new BankAccount();    //acc[1010] -> bname, brname, ifsc etc...
            --
            ---
            // How many uDM ? - as many diff operation our own user defined methode with the required logic 
                1. Perform operatios 
                    storing data in vars or in obj.
                2. reading the values from obj and performing vals and calls
                3. printing the object values on console.

        }
    }

To perform different operations on the object, we must develop logic, where we develop logic?
A) in side a methode - by default inside main method.

What is the problem with main method?
    - The logic placed inside main methode redundant
    - Means we must place same logic again for each object repeatedly.
    - solution: we must place the logic one time and call and execute it repeatedly for each obj or vals separately.
       

What is the need of this chapter?
=====================================
- In this chapter we will learn creating user defined method 
    for developing reusable logic for performing one operation

that operation can be
====================
    1. a mathematical operation
    --------------------------
        like- addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc...

    2. a business object operation
    -------------------------------
        like- deposit, withdraw, book Ticket, buy, sell, etc...

In the previous chapter in P and LV topic
------------------------------------------
we have created one user defined method add() for performing addition operation for given set of new values
That logic in add() method is reusable logic for any given new set of values



Q) What is a method? & What is the use of a method?
=====================================================
A sequence of statements placed as one group with proper name and return type is called
method.

class Addition {

        void add() {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;
        int c = a + b;
        S.o.pln(c);
    }
}

    - A method is a sub block of a class that has name and return type.
    - A method is used for implementing logic to perform one operation

The operation may be mathematical operation or
may be business object operation


Examples for
...................
Mathematical operation method
.................................
        class Addition {

                static int add(int a, int b){

                return a + b;

            }

        }

        Business operation method
......................................
        class BankAccount{

                private double balance;

                void deposite(double amt){

                balance = balance + amt;
                }
        }


How to create a method?
=================================

1) What is an operation?
2) What are the inputs needed to perform this operatin?
3) What is the logic to perform this operation?
4) What is type of result returning from this operation?
5) What is the exception throwing from this operation?
6) What are the permissions we must set to access and execute this operation?

    modifier return type methName(parameter-list)
                        throws <exception-list>
    {
            ----logic----
    }; //;optional


    public static void Meth1(int a, String s){
        sopln(a+s);
    }
    void meth2(){

    }
    abstract void meth3();


Rule in creating a method without body and need of abstract keyword,
========================================================================
    1. we must end this method with; and
    2. we must declare this method with the modifier abstract
    3. we must also declare class as abstract

- To a method, by applying abstract modifier, we are telling to the compiler 
    this method does not have body in this class, it will have body and implementation in the sub class of this class.

- To the class, by applying abstract modifier, we are telling to the compiler, 
    this class contains abstract method, do not allow creating object from this class because the abstract method 
    available in this class can not be executed from this class itself.


Method Terminology:
======================

1) prototype
2) Body and logic
3) Signature
4) Parameter and argument
5) Method name
6) Return type
7) Modifier(AM and ELM)
8) Exceptions list

Method creation terminology:
=============================

1) method declaration
2) method definition
3) method invoking/calling
4) method implementation
5) method overriding
6) method hiding
7) method overloading
8) overridden method overriding method
9) Hidden method hiding method
10) overloaded method overloading method
11) calling method called


Prototype
===============
: The head protion of the method that contains modifiers,
     return type, method name, parameters and throws exceptions list is called prototype

Body:
===============
Just the place between { } is called body

Logic:
=============
The statements placed in method body is called logic

Signature:
================
Method name and parameters list together we called signature.

Paramter :
================
: The variable that is declared in method parathesis () is called parameter.

Argument:
============
The value we are passing as input to a method parameter is called argument



Method name: The name of a method that represents an operation performed by this method is called method name
============
Return type: A data type placed in method prototype before
=============
method name is called return type. The return type is used for specifying what type of value is returning from this method. If we do not want to return a value, we must use void as return type

throws exceptions list:
========================
 exception list represents the run time error that can be occured from this method, if we pass wrong values.

Modifiers: 
================
A keyword or set of keywords those modifiers default behaviour or operation of 
    a programming element is called modifier. The AM specifies where we can access
    this PE and the ELM specifies how we can access and how we can execute this PE,
    either with object or directly by class name.

Develop a program with a method to show all above parts:
=========================================================
            class Addition{
                public static void add(int a, int b)
                {
                    int c = a+b;
                    sop(c);
                }
            }

            // Addition.add(30,12);

//prototype
 public static void main( String [] args)   //AM, ELM, RT, MN, (Parametertype(str), parametername(args) ) -parameter signature  
                    throws exception
//Body
        {
            sopln("Hi");  //logic
        }    


        //main(new String[0]);   // argument-String[0]


Method declaration (abstract method)
========================================

If we create a new method without implementation body, with only prototype, we call it as method declaration.
Method declaration is also called as abstract method.

An abstract method must ends with; and must contain the modifier abstract, 
else compiler will throw error.

Syntax:
    AM abstract RT MN(param-list)  throws EL;

        Ex:
        public abstract void m1();

We will declare methods in super class. For this declared method, implementation (logic) is provided by sub class programmers as per their requirement.


Method Definition (concrete method)
=====================================
If we create a new method with an implementation body, 
we call it as method definition.

A method definition is also called as concrete method.

Syntax:
        AM ELM RT MN(param-list) throws EL
        {
        --------logic-------
        }

        Ex:
        public static void m1 (int x, int y) {
        };

we can create a conctete method either in super class or in sub class

*Rule: In method definition we can not use the modifier abstract

Method Invocation
=======================================
Sending control to a method body to execute its logic is called 
 method invocation or method calling or accessing.

* When we call a method currently running method exeuction is paused, control is sent to this called method,
     this called method logic is executed. After method exeuction is completed, 
     control is returned to calling method, the rest of the statements placed in the calling are executed.

Here we can consider
        -> main method as calling method and
        -> m1 method as called method

        Syntax:
        methodName(args);

if method has parameters we must pass args, else we must not pass arguments

        class Example {
            static void m1(){
                sopln("hellow");
            }

            public static void main(String[] args){
                Sopln("Hi");

                m1();
                sopln("HRU?");
            }

            static void m2(){
                Sopln("WRU?");
            }
        }

//O/P
    Hi
    hellow
    HRU?
