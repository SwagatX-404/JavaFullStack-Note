=================================================
1) What is a void method?
2) What is a non-void methods?
3) When should we create method as void method?
4) When should we create method as non-void method?
5) On what basis we must choose return type to method?
6) How can we return a value from a method?
7) What are diff forms of return statement?
8) What is the purpose of return; and return val; ?
9) What are the rules in using return; and return val; ?
10) What are the rules we must follow in creating void method?
11) What are the rules we must follow in creating nv method?
12) What are the diff ways we can invoke a method?

        class Example{
            static void m1(){
                return;     //correct
                //return;   //wrong   // return val;
            }

            static int m2(){

                return;          //wrong
                return 5;       //correct
                return 'a';     //correct
                return "a";     //wrong
                return 5L;     //wrong
                return 5F;     //wrong
            }
        }


Return Vs Return Value:=============
................................................................
    Return;
    =======
        1) Used for returning control from a methode or from a constructor without value.
        2) It is allowed only inside void method and constructor.
        3) Option to placed by Compiler.

    Return val;
    ===========
        1) Used for Returning a control from method with value.
        2) It is allowed only inside a non-void method. The returning value must be compatible
            and lesser than return type of this method.
        3) Mandatory to place, will not placed by compiler.



Diff ways we can call a void and non-void method
=======================================================

1) Directly by their name ---> m1();
2) As a variable assignment stmt --> int x = m1();
3) As an expression operand -------> int y = 10+m1();
4) As a method argument ---> m2(m1());
   As an argument to Sopln(-) -----> Sopln(m1() );
5) As a method return value -> return m1();


Q) Among above 5 approaches in which approaches we can invoke void and non-void methods?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> a void method can be called only in one way that is in first approach that is directly
-> a non-void method can be called in all 5 approaches +

Example:
__________
        class Example{

            static void m1(){
                Sopln("m1");
            }

            static int m2(){
                Sopln("m2");
                return 50;
            }

            psvm(S[] args){
                
                m1();                      //correct O/P = m1
                //int x = m1();           //wrong CE : i c t
                //Sopln(m1());            // wrong CE:
                .....................................
                m2();                     //correct     m2
                int x = m2();             //correct  x[50]->m2
                Sopln(m2());              //correct  50
            }
        }


Develop a program with void and non-void methods :
=====================================================
- inside void method

1) Create Student class object
2) Initialize it with HK values
3) Display those values in this method itself

- inside non-void method

1) Create Student class object
2) Initialize it with BK values
3) Return this object to calling method

In calling method, main method, display the values from the returned Student object
...............................................................
        class Student{
        --- instance variables
        }

        class College {
        --- void method
        --- non-void method

        }

        class Test {
        main method

        }
