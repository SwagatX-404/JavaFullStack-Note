Reading Runtime Values
__________________________
Need of this chapter?
===========================================================================
    Upto now we have develop a program or a project by hard coding values directly 
    in the variable assignments.


Reading Runtime Values from KB from end-user (RRV)
===================================================
//Addition.java
        class Addition {
            psvm(S a[]){
                
                int a = 10;
                int b = 20;
                int c = a+b;
                sopln(c);
            }// it always adds only 10 and 20 values
        }

//College.java
         class College {
            psvm(S a[]){
                
                Student s1 = new Student();

                s1.sno = 101;
                s1.sname = "SK";
                s1.course= "CJ"
                s1.fee = 10000;
            }// it always create the student SK
        }

The problem in this approach is the program is always exe with the same values.
We can not change those values at execution time without modifying and recompiling the code

1) What is hard coded value and hard coded application?
2) What is runtime value and runtime values application?

4) Diff ways to read runtime values from KB in Java?
        1) From command line
        2) By using System.in

        4) By using BufferedReader class
        5) By using Scanner class

        8) By using AWT
        9) By using Swing
        10) By using Java fx
5) Explain diffs b/w all above approaches and when to use each approach and sample projects?

//Addition.java  -->   [this class Addition is called hard coded application]
        class Addition {
            psvm(S a[]){
                
                int a = 10;     //these values are called
                int b = 20;     //hard coded values
                int c = a+b;
                sopln("Result:"+c);
            }// it always adds only 10 and 20 values
        }


Hard coded values and Hard coded application :
===========================================================================

The values those are directly specificed in a program to store in variables or for performing
 calculations, then those values are technically called hard coded values.

The application that contains values specified directly in its source code to perform 
 validation and calculations is technically called as hard coded application.

The harde coded values are also called as static values because we can not change
 them to another values at progarm execution time.

The hard coded application is also called as static application because
 at this program execution time we can not change the values to another values.


Problems with hard coded application
===============================================================================

We can not change values at execution time, hence this application can be executed 
 only with the same values specified in the program.

For example, consider above class Addition, it will also execute with the values 10 and 20.

If we want to change values, we must modify values in source code, 
then we must recompile and execute this class

As a programmer we can do it, but for an end-user 
 it is very tough modifying Java code every time.

It is not recommanded to develop hard code applications in projects.

We must read and substitue end-user given values to run project.


//Addition.java  -->   [this class Addition is called hard coded application]
        class Addition {
            psvm(S a[]){
                
                int a = 10;     //these values are called <----END_USER
                int b = 20;     //hard coded values  <----END_USER
                int c = a+b;
                sopln("Result:"+c);  //--->END_USER
            }// it always adds only 10 and 20 values
        }


In above program we have not specified values in source code in development time.
 Hence it can be executed with any given new values without modifying code

Runtime value and runtime values application
=============================================================================

The value that reading from end-user and substituting in program 
 at runtime (execution time) is called runtime value

The application that executes logic by reading values 
 from end-user from KB is called runtime application

Runtime values are also called as dynamic values Runtime application
 is alos called as dynamic application

because this application work with user given values.


Advantages of Runtime/Dynamic applications
==============================================================================
    1) It can executed with any given new values
    2) No need to recomiple for changing values
    3) One user values are not misplaced with other user values

It is always recommanded to develop runtime applications in project

All real-time projects you are using dialy are runtime application, 
 just observ once.

Reading runtime values
=============================       =====================       =============
Q1) What is the meaning of runtime value?
    A) The value passing into Java application at the time of execution
       is called runtime value.

Q) What is static value/hard code value?
    A) The value the is specified/placed inside java application 
       at the time of development is called static/hard coded value

Q) What a runtime/dynamic application?
    A) A program/application that does not contains values at the time of 
       development rather if reads values from kb from end-user to executing 
       its logic is called runtime/dynamic application. 
                Ex: Calc application is runtime application

Q) What is static or hard coded application?    
    A) An application that contains values specified in its logic 
       is called static or hard coded application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    1) create Student new instance
    2) read values from end-user
    3) store all these values in above student instance
    4) read and display values from the student instance

Q) How can we connect to keyboard?
Q) How can we read values from keyboard?
Q) How can we read values in their original type?

Q1) How can we connect to kb and read values?
-----------------------------------------------
A) Java supports 10 ways to connect to KB and read values from end-user from KB

        1) From command line
        2) By using System.in
        3) By using DataInputStream
        4) By using BufferedReader class
        5) By using Scanner class
        6) By using Console class
        7) By using System properties
        8) By using AWT
        9) By using Swing
        10) By using Java fx
