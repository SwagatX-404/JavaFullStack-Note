Problems with command line arguments application:
=================================================================
    1) End-user donot get information that he must enter value
    2) End-user donot get information about how many values must enter 
        and which type of values must enter and in which order values must enter
    3) In the middle of the program execution we can not enter values.
        we must enter all values before program execution itself.

Reading runtime values by using Scanner class
==================================================================
1) The class Scanner is newly given in Java 5v
2) Scanner class defined in java.util package
3) Hence we must add import java.util.Scanner in our java file.
4) Scanner class defined with several advantages :

    1) We can read values from kb directly in thier own type 
        we no need to perform converstion.
    2) We can allow user to enter either one value at a time or multiple values 
        as like in cmd line appli, and in program we can read each value individially 
        that to in their own type without developing any additional logic
    3) We no need to handle any exception
    4) object creation statement is short and direct

Reading runtime values by using Scanner class
=================================================================
    5) We must create Scanner class object as shown below
            Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);

    6) Scanner class defined several methods for reading values from KB directly
         in their own type. All method names are starts with the word next following 
         by PDT name. Hence in general Scanner class methods are called nextXxx() methods

The prototype of those methods is

        public xxx nextXxx()      //xxx,Xxx -> PDT name
                    Exception:throws InputMismatch Exception

Reading runtime values by using Scanner class
=================================================================
    7) Scanner class contains the below 9 methods from reading PDT values and String

1) public byte        nextByte()        throws IME
2) public short       nextShort()       throws IME
3) public int         nextInt()         throws IME
4) public long        nextLong()        throws IME
5) public float       nextFloat()       throws IME
6) public double      nextDouble()      throws IME
7) public boolean     nextBoolean()
8) public String      next()
9) public String      nextLine()

Note: Like parseChar() method, here in Scanner class also we do not have nextChar() method.
 Hence by uisng Scanner class approach also we must read a character by using String class charAt(-) method.

Reading runtime values by using Scanner class
================================================================
    8) Sample code to read diff type of values from KB

        Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);

    int i1 = scn.nextInt();
    long 11 = scn.nextLong();
    double d1 = scn.nextDouble();
    char ch = scn.next().charAt(0);
    boolean bo = scn.nextBoolean();
    String str = scn.next();
    String str = scn.nextLine();

Develop Addition class to read interger number by using Scanner class, 
add them and display result

        import java.util.*;

        class Addition {

            public static void main(String[] args) {

            Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);

            System.out.print("Enter FNO: ");
            int a = scn.nextInt();

            System.out.print("Enter SNO: ");
            int b = scn.nextInt();

            int c = a + b;

        System.out.println("Result : "+ c);
     }   }


When will a program execution paused for scn.nextXxx() call?
==========================================================================
When there is no data in Scanner object, scn.nextXxx() method 
call will pause program execution until we enter data.

If data is already available in Scanner object, scn.nextXxx() method 
call will not pause program execution, 
it will read the existing data and contiues execution with this available data

The advantage of Scanner class is
_______________________________________________
By using Scanner class :

    1) we can read one value at a time by prompting separate message.
    2) we can read mulitple values at a time with space separator, 
        and can read each value one a time

Below program shows you reading multiple values at a time 
and returing each value separatly to application like in CMD args application.


    import java.util.*;

    class ReadMulValues Using Scanner{

        ps v main(String[] args){

        Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter nums:")
        int a = scn.nextInt(); 
        int b = scn.nextInt():
        int c = scn.nextInt();

        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(b);
        System.out.println(c);.
}}

Why class name is Scanner and Why did methods name start with next?
=======================================================================
The name Scanner choosen from C lang scanf method point of view 
to give a good feeling to C programmers that Java is also supporting scanf() functionality.

As part Java 5 new features Java started supporting C lang style formting 
input and output values using scanf() and printf() methods

But the method names in Scanner class is not scanf
  rather method names start with next, because through Scanner class
  Java designers want to support reading multiple values at a time 
  and returing each value separately upon the call of scn.nextXxx() method

Here nextXxx() is not only reading, 
after reading it is moving control to next value available in Scanner obj.

Hence its name starts with next

Q) What is the diff b/w next() and nextLine() methods?
========================================================================
    1) next() method will read only one word, 
       it means it read only the characters available upto space

nextLine method will read complete line, 
it means it will read all characaters available upto enter ky

    import java.util.Scanner;

    class NextVsNextLine {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

            Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);

            System.out.print("Enter name: ");
            //String name = scn.next();
            String name = scn.nextLine();

            System.out.println("\nEntered name: " + name);
        }
    }


Develop a program to read a number and name from the console by using Scanner class.
====================================================================================
and identify the problem with nextLine() method and its solution.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    import java.util.Scanner;

    class ReadNumName {

        public static void main(String[] args) {


            Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);

            System.out.print("Num: ");
            int num = scn.nextInt();

            System.out.print("Name: ");
            String name = scn.nextLine();

            System.out.println("\nNum: "+ num);
            System.out.println("Name: "+ name);
         }
    }

RRV: javac ReadNumName.java
RRV: java ReadNumName

Enter number: 101
Enter name :
Entered values
Number:101
Name :

RRV: -  Why nextLine() method did not pause program execution?

When we call nextLine() method after any of remaining 8 nextXxx() methods calling statement,
program execution is not paused, it skips reading input. 
Because it just reads the enter key characters left with previously entered value
 and returns empty string as result to the program.


Solution to Scanner.nextLine() method problem
=============================================================================
When we call scn.nextLine() method after the call of any scn.nextXxx() methods, 
we must call scn.nextLine() method two times, 
second time call must be assign to name value.

First time call is for reading enter key characters and making Sacanner object empty.

Second time call is for pausing program execution 
and reading name value and store in our program.

    int num = scn.nextInt();
    scn.nextLine(); ← 101

    String name = scn.nextLine();   ← SK

Write a program to read and name from keyboard
==============================================================================
    import java.util.Scanner;

    class ReadNumName{

        public static void main(String[] args) {

            Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);

            System.out.print("Enter num: ");
            int sno = scn.nextInt(); 
                      scn.nextLine();   //for enter key

            System.out.print("Enter name: ");
            String sname = scn.nextLine();

            System.out.println("\n\nYou entered");
            System.out.println(" Student num\t: "+ sno);
            System.out.println(" Student name\t: "+ sname);
             }
         }
