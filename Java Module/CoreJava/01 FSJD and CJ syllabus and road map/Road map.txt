What is the Full Stack Development ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The process of developing a complete project end-to-end is called FSD.
    - An end-to-end means from the front-end screens to back-end database tables.
    - Every projects has 3 parts
            1) Frontend  (UI screen)
            2) Middleware  (Programs)
            3) Back-end    (Database)
    Ex: amazone.in

What is Full Stack Java Development ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we develope a project using Java language and Java frameworks we called FSJD.
            1) Front-end    (UI)    -> React,
            2) Middleware   (Programs)  -> Java, SpringBoot,
            3) Back-end     (Database)  -> Oracle, 

SDLC ( Software Development Life Cycle) -
=======================================
    1) Collecting Requirement from client
    2) Analyzing the Requirement
    3) Designing the project

    4) Coding         - Development //Coding - UI, Programming, DB
    5) Unit Testing   

    6) Building       - After Development
    7) Deploying

    8) Testing 
    9) Delivering
    10) Maintainance

Project Architechture_
=====================
User interacts with the 
                          front-end → 
                        → Front-end sends requests to back-end APIs → 
                        → Back-end processes logic and queries the database → 
                        → Response is sent back to the front-end for display.

* Flow Summary: in Project

End-User → UI Input → Controller → Validation → Calculation → Result Generation → Report → DB Tables (store data) → Output/Error shown to user

Java Deeveloper
===============
A Java Developer is a software professional 
who designs, develops, and maintains applications using the Java programming language.
        Develope :
                    backend systems, 
                    web applications, 
                    desktop software,
                    mobile apps 
        using Java technologies
Key Responsibilities:
--------------------
Writing clean and efficient Java code.
Developing and maintaining backend logic using frameworks like Spring Boot or Hibernate.
Connecting applications to databases (MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, etc.).
Testing, debugging, and optimizing application performance.
Collaborating with front-end developers and other team members.

Olden days we have 3 developer 
    1) Web Designer
    2) Web Developer
    3) PL/SQL Developer

Now a days we have only 1 Developer - Full Stack Developer - UI, Programming, Database

Full Stack Java Development Syllabus
====================================
In every project we can perform 2 kind of operations
    1) Development
    2) After Development [buid,deploy,test,...]

Every project has 3 parts.
    1) UI
    2) Programming
    3) Database

All Java Development Course are divided into 5 module.
    1) Java Module
    2) Database Module
    3) UI Module
    4) DevSecOps technologies
    5) AWS Basics

Full Stack Java Learning Road Map
-----------------------------------
We can learn Full Stack Java courses in 2 modes
Duration:

1. Sequentially
- one course after another course (1+ yrs)

2. In parallel
per day [2 or 3] courses (6+ months)

    Level #1:
    Core Java + Oracle + HTML, CSS, JS [2-3 months]

    Level #2
    Adv Java + DevOps Tools AWS [1 month]

    Level #3:
    Spring, SpringBoot, Microservices + React JS [3-4 months]

                    JOB search
Different FSD:
End-user: Frontend & backend
            Frontend-UI
                ->HTML, CSS, JavaSCript, Bootstrap, React etc..

            Backend
                -> Java + SpringBoot + Oracle   - Full Stack JAVA

Diffrenece between FS java, java and Core java ?
    FS java Developer - The skill required to develope one complete project
    Java Developer - Only coding, No-Frontend UI, No-Backend
    Core Java Developer - Just language

Diffrence Java and Python ?
    Java -
    Buisness applications 
    [5th std math] 
    OPP style Enterprise app, complete proj - Frontend, middlewear, backend. ex- Youtube app

    Python - 
    Math based applications 
    [Linear algebra, Statistic]
    Scripting style program - DS, ML,AI. Data Analyzer and recommandation app system video recommandations.

Core Java Syllabus
==================
In Core Java we will learn 'programming' by using Java
In Core Java we will learn

    1. Math based programs:
        Clike add, sub, mul, div, %, palindrome, factorial, patterns, etc...

    2. Business based programs:
        like deposit, withdraw, transferAmt, book Ticket, buy, sell, etc...

    3. Data Structures and Algorithms:
        Llike searching, sorting, inserting, removing, replacing, etc...

For learning above programs easily :

    - Core Java syllabus is divided into 5 units

            Unit #1: Java Fundamentals
            Unit #2: Logical Programming
            Unit #3: Object-Oriented Programming
            Unit #4: Java Library (API)
            Unit #5: Project Development (MVC based)
