==============================================================================
Every programming langauge is meant for developing a program to implement an operation 
to be performed by a computer in an automated way.

Basically programming languages are invented for automating business opearations 
to be perfomed by a computer.

Automation will give several benefits over manual operations
They are:
            1) 24/7 365 days we run our business
            2) We can have good relation with customer
            3) Secured, accurate, efficient, fast transaction

An operation contains below five activities :

    1) reading and storing values
    2) perfoming validations and calculations
    3) Controlling flow of execution
    4) throwing errors if given values are wrong
    5) printing output and error message
<<
Every programming languge will provide the same fundamental concepts 
to perform above five activities to implement logic for an operation 
in developing a program

Every Langauge will provide below 5 concepts to perform above 4 activities, they are
==========================================================================
        1) Data types
        2) Operators
        3) Control flow statements
        4) Exception handling statements
        5) Print statement
The above 5 concepts are technically called Language Fundamentals.

The purpose of above 4 concepts is :
=======================================
    1) Data types : 
                are used for creating a variable and object for 
                storing values in a program

    2) Operators : 
                are used for performing validations and calculations
                to verify the given values are correct or worng 
                for genereating results and for throwing exceptions.

    3) Control flow statements :
                are used for controlling the execution flow of a program 
                based on the given input values. If given values are correct 
                it allows to execute calculations and if given values are worng, 
                it allows to execute throwing exception logic.

    4) Exception handling statements :
                are used for throwing and reporting an exception and further 
                to catch the thrown exception


The concepts object and exception handling statements are exist only in 
OO programming languages such as C++, Java,.Net, PHP, Scala, Python, 
even we have them in PL/SQL.

We do not have object and EH statements in C language.
Summary:
==========
We have 4 language fundamentals for develoing an operation, they are

        1) Data types - for storing values
        2) Operators for performing validations & calculations
        3) Control flow statements -for controlling execution flow
        4) Exception handling statements for throwing & catching an exception

Steps to Build Logic
======================
    1)  Read & Store input values from other programmer or keyboard

        2)  Validate those values =>
        ==========================

3) values are correct    : 4) Perform calculations generate results, return/display result.
3) values are wrong      : 4) throw exception with error message or display error msg.

Develop a program to add two numbers and display result
=========================================================
If the passed number are negative, throw exception IllegalArgumentException
with the error message Do not pass negative numbers.

If the passed numbers are positive, then only add those two numbers and return result.
                //Addintion.java
                ________________________________
    class Addition {
	static int add(int a, int b) throws IllegalArgumentException{
		
		if((a < 0) || (b < 0)){
			throw new IllegalArgumentException(
						"Do not pass -ve number");
		}
		else{
			return a + b;
		}	
	}
                //Calculator.java
                _____________________________________
    class Calalculator {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try{
			int res = Addition.add(7, 8);
			System.out.println("Result: " + res);
		}
		catch(IllegalArgumentException e){
			System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
		}
	}
}

1) In above program we have used data type int for specifying 
    the return type of add metod and for creating parameters for 
    add method and also used for creating a variable in try block for storting result.

2) In above program we have used operators

    <, || for performing validations to know the given values are -ve number or not
    + for performing calculations for adding the given two numbers
    = for assignment operation, means for storing values in the variable

  new for creating IAE class object

3) In above program we have used control flow statements

if and else for taking decision which block of statements
    return   : must execute based on condition retun value for 
               retunring result to calling method main

4) In above program we have used EH statements

    throw   : for throwing an exceptions with error message 
              if given inputs/arguments are wrong

    throws  : for reporting/informing the exceptions throwing out from this method

    try  : for placing exception causing statements and further 
           try to catch this exception in this current method itself.

    catch   : for catching the exception that is raised in try block, 
              and further to place this caught exception handling code to take necessary 
              actions on this exception either displaying error message or doing some other work.

Compilation and execution:
===============================================================
We need to compile only Calculator.java,
Compiler will compile Addition.java file automatically 
because we used class Addition in class Calculator.

        >javac Calculator.java
        |->Calculator.class
        |->Addition.class

Execution Case #1: input values are 10 and 20

        >java Calculator
        Result: 30

Execution Case #2: input values are -10 and 20

        >javac Calculator.java
        >java Calculator

        Do not pass -ve number

Execution flow of above program with case #1: vals 10, 20
===============================================================
    1) End-user executes the class Calculator by passing values 10 and 20
    2) Inside main method, inside try block res variable memory
    3) is created and then add() method is called by passing the values 10 and 20.
    4) Then control goes to Addition class add() method
    5) Inside add() method the input values
                10 will be stored in parameter a
                20 will be stored in parameter b
    6) If condition validation logic is executed, it generates false
          because given two numbers are not -ve numbers
    7) Then control goes to else block
    8) else block logic is executed result 30 is generated
    9) with this result 30 control returns to main method
    10) this result 30 is stored in the variable res
    11) next this result is passed and substituted in Sopln()
    12) finally the result 30 is displayed on console to end-user

Execution flow of above program with case #2: vals -10, 20
====================================================================================
Open Calculator.java and then change values from 10,20 to -10, 20 
then save program, compile and then execute it.

The steps 1,2 and 3 are same as in case #1
  
    1) End-user executes the class Calculator by passing values -10 and 20
    2) Inside main method, inside try block res variable memory
    3) is created and then add() method is called by passing the values -10 and 20.
    4) controls goes to Addition class add method with the values -10 and 20,
    5) These values are stored in parameters a and b resp.
    6) Further if() condition is exeucted with these values, and generates result true,
          becuase given values are -ve
    7) then control goes into if block, executes if block code,
    8) creates exception IAE object with given error message
    9) then throws this IAE to main method
    10) then main method passes this IAE to catch block, catch block with catch this IAE and stores in var e
    11) then catch logic is executed, e.getMessage() method will retrieve the error message from IAE object
    12) finally error msg Donot pass -ve number is displayed on console to the end-user

Run below cases to understand the functionality of throw, throws, try and catch
===============================================================================
Case #1: Remove throws IAE, then compile and execute Calculator class by passing -10, 20

Result:
            <>

Case #2: Place throws IAE, now remove throw new IAE() then compile and execute Calculator class

Result:     <>

Case #3: Place throw new IAE(), now remove try and catch blocks in Calculator class, then com an exe it

Result:     <>
