Java Supports 8 programmig elements
=======================================================================
    1) module
    2) package
    3) class
    4) variables
    5) methods
    6) constructors
    7) blocks
    8) inner classes

1) Java supports all above programming elements
    for representing real-world object in programming world 
    and for implementing OO programming concepts by using Java langauge

2) According OO programming we must devlop all programs around objects.

3) An object is a real-world thing that you can see & use 
    For example: Person, Animal, Vehicle, Mobile, BankAccount, etc... are objects

4) Developing a program around an object means we must create a program

        1) to represent a particular object (ex: Person)
        2) by storing that object values (ex: name,h,w,...)
        3) and by implementing its operations(ex:sleep, eat) 
            by using a class, variables and methods respectively

5)  class   :  is meant for representing object
    variable  :  is meant for representing value
    method  :  is meant for representing operation

6) Hence by using above programming elements
    we must bring real-world objects into programming world to perform 
    their operations by using computer as part of one business application.

            For example:

                Real-World objects
                ------------------
                옷, animal, Vehicle etc....

                ->Java & OOP

                Programming world
                --------------------
                class Person {
                    ---vars
                    ---meths
                }

7) As per above diagram we can conclude that :
=====================================================================================
    1) We must create multiple classes as many diff type of objects as we want to create
    2) In each class we must create mulitple vars based on the multiple values 
        of this object we want to store
    3) Also inside class we must create mul methods based on the multiple operations 
        this object performs.

For example as per above diagram we must create 6 classes with the required nubmer 
of variables and methods.

8) As per above diagram, we must create 6 classes as shown below:
------------------------------------------------------------------
    class Person{
        ---vars
        ---meths
    }

    class Animal{
        ---vars
        ---meths
    }

    class Bike{
        ---vars
        ---meths
    }

    class Mobile{
        ---vars
        ---meths
    }

    class Laptop{
        ---vars
        ---meths
    }

    class BankAccount{
        ---vars
        ---meths
    }

9. Basically by using class, we are binding properties and operations of an object 
    as one group by separating from other object's properties and operations 
    as shown in the above programs.
