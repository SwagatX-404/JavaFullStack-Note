When should we use static members and when should we use non-static members?
=============================================================================
class Example {

static membes
=============

1) static variable
2) static block
3) static method
4) main method
5) static inner class

when store value and execute logic common to all objects

}

non-static members
====================

1) non-static variable
2) non-static block
3) non-static method
4) constructor
5) non-static inner cls

when store value and execute logic specific to one object

What are the members got executed by JVM automatically?
----------------------------------------------------------
Among all these members JVM executesnonly SV, SB, MM automatically.

JVM executes SM only when we invoke it.

JVM executes NSMs only when we create object

A class recommended structure with both SMs and NSMs?

class BankAccount {

            SVs
            NSVS

            SBS
            NSBS

            Constructors

            SMs
            NSMs

            main method
            common method like display

            SICS
            NSICS
}
