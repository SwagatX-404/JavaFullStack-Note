Static and non-static members combination execution flow
========================================================
If a class contains both static and non-static members,
JVM always starts execution with static members.
While executing static members, inside static members body, if 
we create an object, then JVM executes non-static members.

So the flow of execution of both static and non-static members is
	1. First all SVs memory allocated from top to bottom with default values
	2. Then SV assignment and SBs are executed from top to bottom
	3. Finally main method is executed only if this class is run 
	   by using java command. If the class is loaded into JVM by 
	   accessing SV or SM or constructor, main method is not executed.

		if we have created object in any one of the  
		static members SV, SB, MM, SM then NSMs are executed

		4) One new instance is create with new reference	
		5) All NSVs memory allocated in this new instance with default values 
		6) Then all NSVs assignment & all NSBs are executed from top to bottom
		7) Finally the invoked constructor logic is executed
		8) After object initialization, new keyword returns 
		   object reference and stored in referenced variable
	
	9. After all non-static members execution is completed, 
	   JVM continues with next static members execution 
	   as per the flow of execution.

Hence we can conclude JVM starts class execution with SMs
and ends with SMs, in between SMs execution, 
if we create object, NSMs are executed.

We can create object of a class any where in the class,
	1. either at class level by using static and non-static referenced variables
	2. or in SB or in NSB or in constructor or in SM or in NSM or in MM.

Based on the place we have created object, the NSMs are executed
in the middle of SMs execution.
