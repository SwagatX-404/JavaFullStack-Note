What is a variable and what is the use of variable?
====================================================
A variable is a named memory location.
It is used for storing a value (or) object reference temporarily 
during program execution.

        X val/ obj ref

How can create a variable?
====================================================
A variable is created by using data type either by using PDT (or) by using RDT

    -> For storing mathematical value:
        we will create variable by using PDTs byte/short/int/long/float/double/char/boolean

    -> For storing objects we will use RDTs:
        we will create variable by using RDTs
        array/class/interface/enum/annotation

Basic syntax to create a variable:
---------------------------------
       DT varName = value ;

       DT - PDT, RDT
       value - single mathematical value(PDT), object reference(RDT)

       *NOTE : object is created "new" keyword

For Example :
    Below statement shows creating a PDT variable
                int a = 5 ;
            int - data type
            a   - variable name
            5   - literal(value)

Q) What compiler and JVM will do when they come across a variable creation statement?
=====================================================================================
How compiler and JVM will compile and execute below variable creation statement?

        int x = 5;

            dt int is valid
            variable x is valid
            val 5 is compatible and lesser to int dt
        *Hence this line is compiled successfully

→ Compiler is responsible for syntax checking
→ if sytax is correct it generate bytecode,
→ else it will throw error and terminates compilation

→ In a variable creation statement compiler will verify below four rules:

        1) data type is exist or not
        2) var name is valid or not as per identifier rules
        3) value type is compatible with dt or not
        4) value range is <= DT range or not

Note: compiler software is only resposible for checking given 
      variable creation statement syntax, it will not allocate memory for 
      this variable.

Allocating memory for the variable and storing value in that memory 
is the resposibility of JVM.

From a variable creation statement, JVM will

        1) allocate memory, number of bytes based on the dt
        2) name this memory with the given name
        3) store the given value in this memory

From the statement  [ int x = 5; ] JVM will 

        1) creates 4 byte of memory because data type is int
        2) name with memory as x
        3) stores the given value 5 in this memory as shown below

        int x = 5;         //x[5] 4 byte


Q) Will JVM store given value in decimal format as it is?
         It means will JVM store 5 as 5 directly?
=================================================================================================
A) No, JVM internally converts the given decimal value to its equivalent binary number

    for example, JVM will store the value 5 as 0101

    int x = 5;

    short-cut memory
        [5]   ---->  4 bytes memory

    complete memory
            1              2               3             4
    [   00000000   |    00000000  |   00000000  |  00000101  ]
