Coding Standards and Naming Conventions
=========================================

    1). Coding standards are a set of guidelines and best practices designed to help 
        developers write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

    2). As per CS and NC we must provide meaningful and relevant name.

    3). For example in a Bank project development, we must choose

         -  class name as Bank,
         -  variable names as accountNumber, balance, username
         -  method names as withdraw(), deposit(), getBalance(),


Why Coding Standards?
========================

A program is written once, but read many times

    During debugging
    When adding to the program
    When updating the program
    When trying to understand the program

Anything that makes a program more readable and understandable saves lots of time. 
So we must follow coding standards.


Q) If we do not follow above CS and NC will it leads to CE or RE?

A) No CE, No RE.

Your program is not readable, not accepted in the project.

So we can conclude,
 CS and NC are contracts among all Java developers 
 to develop project with same style of code and facilitate collaboration among developers.


class : 
=======
representing object -> noun every word fist letter must be capital

variable :
=========
reprsents value -> countable noun 1st word 1st letter small, 
            after that every word 1st letter must be capital

method :
=======
represents operation -> verb same as variable naming convension but must ends with ()

final variable :
==============
all charcters must be capital and words must be separated by

package :
=========
represents group -> common noun all characters must be small length must be as short as possible

module :
=======
representing group -> common noun same as package, must 2 words with


Identify which name represents which type of PE?
===================================================
Rectangle           - AbcBbcCbc
BankAccount         - abcBbcBbc
bankAccount         - abcBbcCbc()
findTotalTax        - abc
findTotalTax()      - abc.bbc


Explain System.out.println()?
============================

class FirstProgram{
    public static void main ( String[] args){

        System.out.println("Hiiiiii");
    }
}

> FirstProgram  :   class name
> main          :   methode name
> String []     :   classname
> args          :   var name
> out           :   variable, !package
> println       :   method name 


Special usage of _ and $
========================

finale variable :
                    MINBALANCE - wrong way
                    MIN_BALANCE - correct way 

                    numberOfStudents - correct way
                    number_Of_Student - wrong way

$ is autogenerated names :
            //A.java                 //A-outer class, B-inner class
                        class A{
                            class B{

                            }
                        }
                >javac A.java
                | A.class
                | A$B.class    //$ auto generated names


boolean type variable naming conversion
========================================

boolean flag = false;       |       boolen rowCreated = false;
flag = true;                |       rowCreated = true;
if(flag){                   |       if(rowCreated){
                            |                    }
}
