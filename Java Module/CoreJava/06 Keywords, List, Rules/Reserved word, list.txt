Q) What are the differences between reserved word and keyword? 
   Can we call a keyword is a reserved word?
===============================================================

> Every keyword is a reserverd word, but every reserved word is not a keyword.

    For example:
    ------------
    'null' is a reserved word but it is not a keyword, 'class' is a reserved word and alsó a keyword

A reserved word that performs some special operation in a Java program is called a keyword.

    We have 71 reserved words, among them
        51 are keywords, 
        3 are literals, 
        10 are restricted kws
        7 special identifiers

1]  We can't use 51 keywords and 3 literals as user defined identifiers
2]  We can use 10 restricted keywords and 7 special identifiers as user defined identifiers


Java 8v reserved words
========================
In Java 8v, we have only 53 reserved words Among them 
    50 are keywords and 3 are reserved literals

53 Reserved Words
-----------------
   1) 50 Keywords   =   48 implemented keywords = [class, void, static, public...]
                    =   2 unimplemented keywords = [goto, const]

   2) 3 reserved literals     =  [true, false, null] 


    - A reserved word that got some implemented logic to perform 
      one operation in a program is called a KW

    - A reserved word that represents a value is called a literal


The keywords goto and const are reserved, even though they are not currently used.
This may allow a Java compiler to produce better error messages if these C++ keywords
 incorrectly appear in programs.


Java 9v reserved words
=======================
In Java 9v, 1 new keyword and 10 restricted keywords are added Hence in Java 9v we have 64 reserved words

64 Reserved Words
-----------------
        1) 51 Keywords      = 48 implemented keywords = [class, void, static, public...]
                            = 3 unimplemented keywords = [goto, const, _ ]

        2) 3 reserved literals  =   [true, false, null] 
        3) 10 Restricted KWs    =   [module, transitive. to, with,...]


Java 10v to 22v reserved words
===================================
From Java 10v to 22v, 7 new special identifiers are added These 7 words are not keywords. 
In total we have 71 reserved words.

71 Reserved Words
-----------------
        1) 51 Keywords      = 48 implemented keywords = [class, void, static, public...]
                            = 3 unimplemented keywords = [goto, const, _ ]

        2) 3 reserved literals  =   [true, false, null] 
        3) 10 Restricted KWs    =   [module, transitive. to, with,...]

        4) 7 special or reserved identifiers    = [var, record, yield, sealed, non-sealed permits, when]

* We can not use 51 kws and 3 literals as identifiers 
* We can use 10 restricted kws and 7 special identifiers as user defined identifiers


Java 17v reserved words division names
======================================
In Java 17v, reserved words are divided into 3 groups

Upto Java 16v groups names
--------------------------
    1. Keywords
    2. Reserved Literals
    3. Restricted Keywords
    4. Sepecial identifiers

Java 17v onwards group names
-----------------------------
    1. Reserved Keywords (51)
    2. Reserved Literals (3)
    3. Contextual Keywords (17)


Keywords, rules, list of kws, Java 9 ench
=============================================
Note: We have two levels of predefined identifiers
    1) Reserved words and keywords
    2) Class, variable, method names

A word that is created as part of compiler and JVM softwares to perform 
one operation is called keyword and a word that is created as part of compiler 
and JVM softwares to represent a value is not called as keyword, but is just called as reserved word.

A word that is created as part of library(API) is not called as keyword, 
it is just called as predefined identifier. And these identifiers are enclosed or under 
the scope of class and package.


Where as keywords are not under any scope or not enclosed by any thing. 
Hence keywords are directly accessible in our program.

Therefore we can not use keywords or reserved words as userdefined identifier, 
because we and compiler can not differentiate. +

But we can use predefined identifier as user defined identifer, 
because we can differentiate them using c/p
